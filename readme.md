These queries were generated by script `query_elli.py` by `party-elli`, SMT-based bounded synthesizer.

The last number in queries' file names (e.g., `tmpn9gtsd_1_1.smt2`)
indicates the size of the model we search.
Do not get confused by queries content -- any query first declares that a model can have ~hundreds of states, but then later we restrict the model transition function to have the desired number states.

The last number in directory names (e.g., `full-arbiter-mealy-2`) usually means the number of 'clients' (e.g., for arbiters, `2` means two output grant signals, two input request signals).
